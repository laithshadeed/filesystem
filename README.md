## In memory filesystem (2012)

```
This is an interview question in Gayle Laakmann McDowell book
about cracking the coding interviews. The idea just to try using OOP to
design a filesystem.
```

## Reflection

This was an attempt in some week-end to both refresh on C++ and try
something different. Of course it is far from being called a filesystem
:smile: I uploaded it here for the sake of self reflection. Previous
samples
- Java ([2010](https://github.com/laithshadeed/expression-tree))
- C++ ([2011](https://github.com/laithshadeed/log-parser))
